# Wordpress backup

This repo is an automated backup of all posts and pages on https://blog.jakelee.co.uk using [WordPress GitHub Sync](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-github-sync/).
  
A full guide to setting this up on your own Wordpress site is [available on... my blog (unsurprisingly!)](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/how-to-automatically-backup-wordpress-posts-to-github/).

Whilst the repo is pretty self-evident:

* `_pages` are all pages on the blog.
* `_posts` are all posts on the blog.
