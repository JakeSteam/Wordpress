Over on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">/r/AndroidDev</a>, we're shortly going to be hosting AMAs from a few prominent devs. In preparation for this, I wanted to revisit Reddit's user flair system, so users can have their employer's icon. Whilst I've assigned plenty of flairs over on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">/r/Android</a>, I've never actually created one from scratch. The end result of this tutorial will be the ability to easily give your subreddit's users custom image flairs, whilst allowing them to add their own text.

Note that this will not work on the Reddit redesign, as it doesn't appear to currently have the flexibility with images / "emojis" required.

<h2>Preparing your icons</h2>
First, you need to find the images you want to use for flairs. These should be square, and at least 16x16 pixels, although 64x64 will look much better.

You can find your images from various places, depending on what you're using flair for. I had to resize a few icons in Photoshop, as a few couldn't be found in the necessary 64x64.

For the /r/AndroidDev images, I looked on the company's branding site, their LinkedIn profile pictures, and sometimes the start of their site's source code (as it contained a 64x64 favicon). Once I had all my images ready, I moved on to creating a sprite sheet...

<h2>Creating a sprite sheet</h2>
You now need to make a single image that contains all of your flair images, stacked vertically. You can either do this yourself, or use an online tool like <a href="https://spritegen.website-performance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpriteGen</a>. If using SpriteGen, follow these steps:
<ol>
 	<li>Press "Clear" to remove the default images.</li>
 	<li>Press "Open" and add all of your sprites.</li>
 	<li>Under Settings, change your Layout to "Vertical" and your Padding to "0px".</li>
 	<li>Your images should now look like the image below.</li>
 	<li>Click "Downloads" and click "Spritesheet". Note that CSS is generated by this tool, but it's not useful for our purposes!</li>
 	<li>Rename this file to <code>flair-spritesheet.png</code> or similar, as many themes already have a <code>spritesheet.png</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating your CSS</h2>
You now need to make the actual changes to your subreddit! We'll upload our spritesheet, then set up some CSS to give styles to the flair classes.

First, head to your subreddit's stylesheet ("edit stylesheet" on sidebar or <code><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yoursubredditname/about/stylesheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/yoursubredditname/about/stylesheet/</a></code>). Then, on the image selector, choose your <code>flair-spritesheet.png</code>, make sure the "new image name" is <code>flair-spritesheet</code>, and press "Upload".

Add the following to the very bottom of the (possibly empty) CSS code box:
<pre>.flair:before{
    content:"";
    height:16px;
    margin-top:-2px;
    background-repeat:no-repeat;
    background-image:url(%%flair-spritesheet%%);
    background-size:auto 64px;
    display:inline-block;
    vertical-align:middle
}

.flair-android:before{width:16px;background-position: 0 -0px}
.flair-discord:before{width:16px;background-position: 0 -16px}
.flair-google:before{width:16px;background-position: 0 -32px}
.flair-nerdery:before{width:16px;background-position: 0 -48px}</pre>
Each flair we're adding is a new CSS class, with a very simple piece of code. This code sets the image flair's width, and how much of an offset on the spritesheet to use to find the image. Under the <code>.flair:before</code>'s class, the <code>background-size</code> value must be changed if you are using an image size other than 64x64.

We now have flair classes of <code>android</code>, <code>discord</code>, <code>google</code>, and <code>nerdery</code> set up!
<h2>Assigning the flair</h2>
To actually give users this flair, head to the "edit flair" option in the sidebar (or <code><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/about/flair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/about/flair/</a></code>). Under the "grant flair" tab, enter the user you wish to give a flair, and press "Go".

You can now choose the text that appears next to their name, as well as the image flair. For example, I want the Discord icon next to my name, so I set <code>discord</code> as the CSS class (derived from the <code>flair-discord</code> CSS class defined earlier).

Press "Save", and you'll see the new flair:

And here's how it looks next to my name. Perfect!

<h2>Adding new flairs</h2>
To add new flairs, just:
<ul>
 	<li>Add your new 64x64 image to the bottom of the <code>flair-spritesheet.png</code>.</li>
 	<li>Reupload it, overwriting the existing one.</li>
 	<li>Add a new row to the CSS, with the final number changed to 16px lower than the last row.</li>
 	<li>Save the CSS.</li>
</ul>
For example, if I was going to add a new flair after <code>.flair-nerdery:before{width:16px;background-position: 0 -48px}</code>, it would be <code>.flair-newcompany:before{width:16px;background-position: 0 -64px}</code>.
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
As mentioned before, I don't believe this system can work on the Reddit redesign. Whilst I could add mod-only emojis of company icons, add them to flairs, and then assign them to users, these emojis wouldn't actually appear. I'm assuming this is because the users were not mods. Hopefully future improvements to the flair system allow for a simple system that works on both old and new designs.

I'd also like to mention a frequently referenced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/wiki/userflair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user flair tutorial from 2015</a>. I used this for my first attempt, but discovered that it could only handle 16x16 images, which looked pretty bad in almost all cases.

Finally, if you are going to use other sizes than 16px for the displayed image and 64px for the source images, you just need to replace every instance of the value. You can have much larger displayed flairs, but they'll start messing up the page's layout pretty quickly!
