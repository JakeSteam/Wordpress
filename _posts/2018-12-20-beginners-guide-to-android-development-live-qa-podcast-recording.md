A couple of months ago the guys at <a href="https://enhance.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enhance.co</a> hopped on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TnJRnf4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Dev Discord</a> and took a few questions from the members there. After a few delays this 90 minute podcast is now <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jakesteam/android-dev-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up on Soundcloud</a>, and embedded below!

The podcast covered topics from game engines and Flutter to app publishers and testing, many thanks to the hosts!
