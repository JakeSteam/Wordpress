Recently I needed to update some marketing images in an Android app, based on our designer's Zeplin screens.

Exporting &amp; using these images is usually no problem, but this time our QA reported the images had an unusual white line at the bottom or right on some devices! I manually fixed them in PhotoShop, then hunted for the root cause...

<h2>Densities</h2>
To understand why this happens, we first need to quickly understand <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android's densities</a>. Different devices have differences in quality &amp; size of screen, so to make a 2cm wide image on one device might need 50 pixels, on another it might need 250. <a href="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/devices-density_2x.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2766 size-full" src="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/devices-density_2x.png" alt="" width="1000" height="380" /></a>

This is why we package differenceÂ <strong>densities</strong> of every image, so we can display smaller images on smaller / lower resolution devices, and vice versa. On Android we primarily deal with the following 5 densities, which can all be expressed as multiples of each other: mdpi(1x), hdpi (1.5x), xhdpi (2x), xxhdpi (3x), and xxxhdpi (4x).
<h2>The problem</h2>
The specific asset we were using had a resolution of 3072x444 pixels at the highest density, that is then downscaled for our various densities:
<ul>
 	<li>xxxhdpi: 3072x444</li>
 	<li>xxhdpi: 2304x333</li>
 	<li>xhdpi: 1536x222</li>
 	<li><strong>hdpi: 1152x166.5</strong></li>
 	<li>mdpi: 768x111</li>
</ul>
Notice the non-whole number there? That's a problem!

When Zeplin is generating this asset for export, it rounds the size up to 1152x167. However, it has no data for what to put in there so leaves it as a transparent pixel. This is usually fine, unless you're exporting as as a JPG without transparency, in which case you'll end up with... our white pixel row / column.
<h2>The solution</h2>
Luckily, this is really, really easy to fix. If our xxxhdpi asset was instead 3072x440, we'd now have the much nicer:
<ul>
 	<li>xxxhdpi: 3072x440</li>
 	<li>xxhdpi: 2304x330</li>
 	<li>xhdpi: 1536x220</li>
 	<li><strong>hdpi: 1152x165</strong></li>
 	<li>mdpi: 768x110</li>
</ul>
Now when we export our assets, we end up with the following (old on top, new on bottom), notice the lack of white pixel?

There we go! So long as the mdpi asset has an even number of pixels in it's width and height, there'll be no problems.
