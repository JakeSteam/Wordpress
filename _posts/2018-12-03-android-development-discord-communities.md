Whilst developing for Android, it's often necessary to ask others for help, or discuss concepts / news. Whilst <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android">StackOverflow</a> is excellent for solving problems long-term, sometimes it's easier to talk through something in realtime. To that end, <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> is an excellent resource, this post will introduce a few of the larger communities.

I currently help moderate all of these communities, so feel free to message me on Discord (@JakeSteam#9845) with any questions!

<h2>Android Development Servers</h2>
<a href="https://discord.gg/TnJRnf4">Android Dev</a>: This is the main Android development server. With over 3,000 members, the #beginner and #intermediate rooms have helpful people available 24/7. There are also specialist rooms to discuss libraries like #firebase and #dagger, and lots of information in #useful-resources. Finally, there is also #promotion, #app-showcase, and #hiring to promote various types of content.

<a href="https://discord.gg/qgs7DNe">Flutter Dev</a>: Whilst smaller than the main server (1.6k members), the specialised nature of the server (Google's Flutter framework) means it is much more helpful than the #flutter channel of Android Dev. As it is part of the same server network as Android Dev (<a href="https://discord.gg/B5YCN6N">Devs on Discord</a>), they share the same channel structure.

<h2>General Android Servers</h2>
<a href="http://discord.gg/android">/r/Android</a>: This massive server (12k users) is loosely affiliated with the subreddit, but has a very different tone. With very relaxed rules, most of the conversation ends up happening in #offtopic.

<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/android"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2106" src="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/android.png" alt="" width="474" height="378" /></a>

<a href="https://discord.gg/Fa9ahHK">/r/AndroidGaming</a>: This server (1.4k members) focuses on gaming news and discussion, as well as game recommendations and sharing content. Special roles are available for YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and game developers.

<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Fa9ahHK"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2107" src="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/androidgaming.png" alt="" width="473" height="375" /></a>

<a href="https://discord.gg/Cw62EkV">/r/AndroidQuestions</a>: This server is quieter than the others, and is full of people asking questions, and a few helping. Generally the subreddit is a better place to ask, but it can't hurt asking here too.

<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Cw62EkV"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2108" src="https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/androidquestions.png" alt="" width="471" height="377" /></a>
